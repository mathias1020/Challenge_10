# **Crypto Currency Analysis Using KMeans Clustering & PCA**

This notebook is a performance analysis of a portfolio of crypto currencies over various timeframes.  It leverages KMeans analysis as aclustering technique to identify relationships among the various cryptocurrencies being evaluated.  The initial analysis performs the KMeans clustering without leveraging PCA and then the same analysis is performed by leveraging PCA to simplify the analysis.
